# STAT
---
a Simple Tool for the Advancement of your Terminal

...or, information you need stat.

---

Stat is a tool written in Python that allows you to work exclusively in the terminal.

I wrote it so I could bring my small laptop to class to take notes in just the terminal.

Stat gives you important information, such as your battery life, the time, the date, RAM/CPU usage, and more.
